# Day 10 of learning JavaScript
Today I learned about array methods, which are map, reduce, and filter.

## array.map()
map() is an array method that creates a new array by applying a callback function to each element of the original array.
- It returns a new array.
- It does not mutate the original array.
- It is used when we want to transform data.

## array.filter()
filter() is an array method that creates a new array containing only the elements that pass a given condition.
- It returns a new array.
- It does not mutate the original array.
- It is used to select or remove elements.

## array.reduce()
reduce() is an array method that reduces all elements of an array to a single value by executing a reducer function on each element.
- It returns any single value (number, object, array, etc.)
- It uses an accumulator.
- It is the most powerful (and most confusing) array method.
